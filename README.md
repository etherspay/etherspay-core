## Specification

### Simple summary
A standard interface for preauthorized, recurring subscription payments.

### Abstract
This standard defines a contract interface enabling subscribers to make recurring payments to a merchant, and for the contract to then make this payment on behalf of the subscriber at the predetermined interval.

This standard provides basic functionality to initiate, approve, and manage subscriptions between a subscriber and merchant. These subscriptions allow a merchant to transfer a pre-authorized amount of ERC-20 tokens within each recurring time interval.

### Features
* Subscriptions can be created, approved, and cancelled by either the subscriber or merchant.
* Subscriptions can be created with a specified start date, and can be cancelled at any time.
